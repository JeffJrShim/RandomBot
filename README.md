![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/810291025909383178.gif?v=1&size=16) RandomBot is just a simple Discord bot I decided to make on my free time. The bot is focused around random values and the commands also are focused on random values.

> What it does have: it has random value commands because that was the bot was focused around

> What it doesn't have: it doesn't have most of the commands other bot's do, because its focused around random values.

> What is the bot's prefix? The prefix is `rb.`.

> The bot's library: the bot uses the discord.py library (but there is a JS one)

> How do I invite RandomBot? You can click this link to invite RandomBot: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=716309071854174268&permissions=8&scope=bot

> Do we have a website? Yes, we do! The link to it is here: https://randombot.tk

> DM me if you want more info, I keep them open.
